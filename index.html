                <p>On this webpage ur going to see some information about: <strong>K-pop, C-pop</strong> and <strong>J-pop</strong>. But first let me tell u something about the history.</p>
                <h2>K-POP</h2>
                <p>K-pop stands for 'Korean-Popular Music'. It's a genre of music originating in South-Korea as part of South-Korean culture. It is influenced by styles and genres from around the world, such as pop, experimental, rock, jazz, gospel, hip hop, R&B, reggae, electronic dance, folk, country, and classical on top of its traditional Korean music roots. The more modern form of the genre emerged with the formation of one of the earliest K-pop groups, the boy band Seo Taiji and Boys, in 1992. Their experimentation with different styles and genres of music and integration of foreign musical elements helped reshape and modernize South Korea's contemporary music scene. On this webpage I will tell u something about Korean <a href="boy groups.html">boy-</a> and <a href="girl groups.html">girl groups</a>.
                <h2>C-POP</h2>
                <p>C-pop stands for 'Chinese-Popular Music'. It's a loosely defined musical genre by artists originating from the Greater China region. This includes countries where Chinese languages are used by parts of the population, such as Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia. C-pop is used as an umbrella term covering not only Chinese pop but also R&B, ballads, Chinese rock, Chinese hip hop and Chinese ambient music, although Chinese rock diverged during the early 1990s. There are currently three main subgenres within C-pop: Cantopop, Mandopop and Hokkien pop. The gap between Cantopop and Mandopop has been narrowing in the new millennium. Hokkien pop, initially strongly influenced by Japanese enka, has been re-integrating into C-pop and narrowing its trend of development towards Mandopop. Chinese popular music was initially a vehicle for the Cultural Revolution and Maoist ideologies; however, during the country's extensive political and cultural changes of the past 50 years, it has lost much political significance; and now closely resembles the styles of K-pop and J-pop, from South Korea and Japan, respectively.

                <h2>J-POP</h2>
                <P>J-pop stands for 'Japanese-Popular Music'. It's a musical genre that entered the musical mainstream of Japan in the 1990s. Modern J-pop has its roots in traditional Japanese music, but significantly in 1960s pop and rock music, such as The Beatles and The Beach Boys, which led to Japanese rock bands such as Happy End fusing rock with Japanese music in the early 1970s. J-pop was further defined by new wave and crossover fusion acts of the late 1970s such as Yellow Magic Orchestra and Southern All Stars, then Eurobeat in the early 1990s, namely Namie Amuro. Eventually, J-pop replaced kay≈çkyoku ("Lyric Singing Music", a term for Japanese popular music from the 1920s to the 1980s) in the Japanese music scene. The term was coined by the Japanese media to distinguish Japanese music from foreign music and now refers to most Japanese popular music. Popular styles of Japanese pop music included technopop during the 1970s to 1980s, city pop in the 1980s, and Shibuya-kei in the 1990s.
